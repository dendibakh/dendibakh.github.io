In this short blog post I decided to capture the most important highlights from all the Twitter Spaces conversations that I had during the year 2021. Some of those are not exact quotes, but rather my interpretation of their thoughts, I hope they call me out when I misinterpreted something. In no particular order:

1. 
Daniel Lemire:
"Benchmarking should become as common as unit tests."
"Think about SW performance from the first principles. Ask yourself: how fast my code COULD run."

Low-latency industries (high-frequence trading, real-time robotics) fight hard the fact that most of HW and SW components are build around maximizing throughput, not latency. Mark Dawson

Nadav Rotem - how important perf is for Facebook.
"Right now LLVM compiler optimizes C++ as if it was C, pointers all over the place. We need to capture high-level language semantics as well." Nadav Rotem.

Memory bottlenecks are the most common performance issue in modern SW. Ivica Bogosavljevic

"I predict that performance optimization and efficiency in the cloud is going to be way more important 5 years down the line and 10 years down the line to the point where we will eventually have the equivalent of the C-level executive in organizations thatâ€™s responsible for the efficient delivery of digital goods." - Thomas Dullien

If you were my guest and you don't see yourself in this list, sorry, I haven't save the notes for every episode, so it's hard for me to recover everything. Sorry about that.
