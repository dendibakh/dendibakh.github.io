In this short blog post I decided to capture the most important highlights from all the Twitter Spaces conversations that I had during the year 2021. Some of those are not exact quotes, but rather my interpretation of their thoughts, I hope they call me out when I misinterpreted something. In no particular order:

Daniel Lemire:
"Benchmarking should become as common as unit tests." Think about SW performance from the first principles. Ask yourself: how fast my code COULD run."

Nadav Rotem:
"Right now LLVM compiler optimizes C++ as if it was C (pointers all over the place)." We could benefit from capturing high-level language semantics as well.

Mark Dawson:
Low-latency industries (high-frequence trading, real-time robotics) fight hard the fact that most of HW and SW components are build around maximizing throughput, not latency. 

Ivica Bogosavljevic:
"Memory bottlenecks are the most common performance issue in modern SW."

Thomas Dullien:
"I predict that performance optimization and efficiency in the cloud is going to be way more important 5-10 years down the line to the point where we will eventually have the equivalent of the C-level executive in organizations thatâ€™s responsible for the efficient delivery of digital goods."

Tomer Morad:
"The world doesn't like to do SW performance tuning". Systems should be able to tune themselves automatically.

James Reinders:
"Parallelism is in data." A better algorithm is better than a better HW :) . "SW libraries should be heterogeneous from the start". "We all will be heterogeneous devs in 10 years from now". 

Arnaldo Carvalho De Melo:
"BPF is eating the world".

Bryan Cantrill:
"People serious about SW do their own HW." The future is in HW/SW co-designed open platforms.

Andrey Akinshin:
There is no universal benchmarking method/approach that can be applied everywhere. Benchmarking very much depends on your business goals.

## Tools that we were talking about:
OxideComputer -
Prodfiler - 
Concertio -
SYCL - 

If you were my guest and you don't see yourself in this list, sorry, I haven't save the notes for every episode, so it's hard for me to recover everything. Sorry about that.
