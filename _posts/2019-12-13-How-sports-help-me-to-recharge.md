This post is not what I usually blog about. :) I regularly write about technical stuff, not about personal life and fitness. But damn, sometimes it's okay to change something. **Anyway, keep on reading, but remember I warned you, there will be zero technical value in this post.**

One reader of my blog wrote to me: "Hey, I found your Instagram account and thought it's not you, there are so many sports photos." Well, yeah, that's true. Sports was always a part of my live. I don't remember a single week I haven't been exercising. Maybe except when I was sick. And over the past few years I started feeling how I essentially can't live without going for a little running workout or playing soccer.

Whenever I feel overwhelmed, I try to wrap up any activity I'm now working on and do some sports.

All the greatest thoughts are coming while running. It is funny, but often times I come from my workout and immediately write down the thought that came while I was running. I don't know how it works on the body level, but I feel so much more confident while running. I'm ready to tackle any challenge I might face.

Additionally, I always listen audiobooks while running. I have [Audible](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PCV9DSZ/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=dendibakh-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07PCV9DSZ&linkId=ef3f26e0bbecedafd08e383557e078b0) subscription which provides me with hours of good audiobooks. By having running workouts, I have listened to a big number of audiobooks I wouldn't find the time to listen otherwise. It is 2in1: it not only saves my time, but it helps to be distracted from actual running. For professionals this is rather a drawback then an upside, but for me it's good. Sometimes the 5 mile run feels like 5 minutes when all my thoughts are about the book I'm listening to.

There is one good thing about daily sport commitments. **I believe it trains our mind in doing things that do not necessary bring you joy and happiness. It develops confidence and discipline**. And not just in sports but in my daily job as well. During the years I made such an observation, that I tend to procrastinate more when I miss my physical exercises.

Everything what I wrote is not new, I know. But if I could inspire at least one reader to make sport activities a daily routine, I will consider it a success.
