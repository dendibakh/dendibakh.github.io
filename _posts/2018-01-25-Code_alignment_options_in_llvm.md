In my [previous post]({{ site.url }}/blog/2018/01/18/Code_alignment_issues) I discussed code alignment issues that could arise when you benchmarking your code. [Simon](https://twitter.com/TartanLlama) in the comments mentioned code alignment option '-align-all-nofallthru-blocks'. If we look at what description says about this option it's not clear what this option is doing. So, I decided to give some clear examples of what it's doing.

In latest llvm (as of 25.01.2018) there are 3 machine-independent option for controling code alignment:
```
-align-all-blocks=<uint>            
  Force the alignment of all blocks in the function.
-align-all-functions=<uint>
  Force the alignment of all functions.
-align-all-nofallthru-blocks=<uint>
  Force the alignment of all blocks that have no fall-through 
  predecessors (i.e. don't add nops that are executed).
```

Let's take an example like this:

```cpp
int foo();
int bar();

void func(int* a)
{
  for (int i = 0; i < 32; ++i)
    a[i] += 1;

  if (a[0] == 1)
    a[0] += foo();
  else
    a[0] += bar();
}
```
For this code compiled with `-O2 -march=skylake -fno-unroll-loops` clang will produce this assembly:
```asm
0000000000000040 <_Z4funcPi>:
  40:	push   rbx
  41:	mov    rbx,rdi
  44:	mov    rax,0xffffffffffffff80
  4b:	vpcmpeqd ymm0,ymm0,ymm0
  4f:	nop
  50:	vmovdqu ymm1,YMMWORD PTR [rbx+rax*1+0x80]
  59:	vpsubd ymm1,ymm1,ymm0
  5d:	vmovdqu YMMWORD PTR [rbx+rax*1+0x80],ymm1
  66:	add    rax,0x20
  6a:	jne    50 <_Z4funcPi+0x10>
  6c:	cmp    DWORD PTR [rbx],0x1
  6f:	jne    7b <_Z4funcPi+0x3b>
  71:	vzeroupper 
  74:	call   79 <_Z4funcPi+0x39>
  79:	jmp    83 <_Z4funcPi+0x43>
  7b:	vzeroupper 
  7e:	call   83 <_Z4funcPi+0x43>
  83:	add    DWORD PTR [rbx],eax
  85:	pop    rbx
  86:	ret
```

And here is the vizualization (created with [this](https://github.com/radare/radare2) tool) for this assembly where we can see the basic blocks (BB):
![](/img/posts/CodeAlignmentOptions/bb.png){: .center-image }

Below I will show the difference in different code aligning options. All the code and scripts that I used can be found [here](https://github.com/dendibakh/dendibakh.github.io/tree/master/_posts/code/CodeAlignmentOptions).

### align-all-functions

This option will align all your functions on a bounday specified in the parameter. For example, `-mllvm -align-all-functions=5` will align all functions on a 32B boundary (`2^5=32`). 

Regarding our case (don't look at the offsets in visual representation) function is already aligned at 64B boundary so, the only difference will be if we specify `-mllvm -align-all-functions=7`:


![](/img/posts/CodeAlignmentOptions/align_functions.png){: .center-image }

### align-all-blocks

Apply this option carefully because it can cause lot of nops be added into the assembly. Adding `-mllvm -align-all-blocks=5` yields this diff:

![](/img/posts/CodeAlignmentOptions/align_blocks.png){: .center-image }

> Note that this option does not align the function beginning, but rather it's first basic block.

I will not show the results of what will happen if I will specify 6 or 7, because it won't fit on a screen.

### align-all-nofallthru-blocks

This option as opposed to blindly aligning all blocks does it in a smarter way. The description looks complicated, but in fact it's really simple. Algorithm looks like this: for each BB we check if a previous BB can reach current BB by falling through. If it can, we don't align such current, because it means that we will insert NOPs into the executed path (as the opposite to `-align-all-blocks`). If the previous BB can't reach current BB by falling through, it means that the only way we can reach current BB is by jumping into it and the previous block ends with unconditional branch, so we can safely insert nops between previous and current BB, knowing that those NOPs won't be executed.

In our function there is only one such BB (that has a call to `bar()`). Here is the diff for `-mllvm -align-all-nofallthru-blocks=5`:

![](/img/posts/CodeAlignmentOptions/align_no_fall_thru_blocks.png){: .center-image }

Again, all the code and scripts that I used can be found [here](https://github.com/dendibakh/dendibakh.github.io/tree/master/_posts/code/CodeAlignmentOptions), so free to play with different options.

### Conclusion

By now I hope it's clear what those code alignment options mean, but I encourage you to use them with care. The most safe IMHO is the `-align-all-nofallthru-blocks`, however it also doesn't come for free - it increases the binary size.
