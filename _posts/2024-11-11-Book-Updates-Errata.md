### Errata

22-Nov-2024: A couple of readers of the paperback version have reported that there are some blurry pages and some pages have purple-ish text color (instead of black). I acknowledge this issue and I'm trying to fix it. The hardcover version (with premium color printing) seems not to have this problem. It turns out to be an issue with the LaTeX to PDF conversion. Some details are here: https://www.kdpcommunity.com/s/question/0D7at0000022jCnCAI.

24-Dec-2024: The following link on page 253 (Chapter 11, PGO) is outdated: https://github.com/google/llvm-propeller/blob/plo-dev/Propeller_RFC.pdf, use the following link instead: https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3575693.3575727.

24-Dec-2024: Bad image formatting in Appendix: some images cover the text.

24-Dec-2024: The following link on page 332 (Appendix C, Intel PT) is outdated: https://sites.google.com/site/intelptmicrotutorial/.
