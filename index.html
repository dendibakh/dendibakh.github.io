<p>Welcome to easyperf! This is a blog about <span itemprop="title">performance analysis and tuning, C/C++ compilers and CPU architecture</span>. I started it in 2016 with a simple goal in mind: educate software developers to better understand their applications' performance on modern hardware. Remember that optimizations that you implement in your code should be driven by careful performance analysis, not your intuition. If you want to learn how to squeeze the last bit of performance from your application, this blog is for you.</p>
