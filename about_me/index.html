  <div class="about_me">
    
  <p class="lead"><b> Hello!</b></p>
  <p>My name is Denis, I'm a SW developer with more than 15 years of experience. I started my journey as a developer of desktop applications, then I developed embedded SW and now I'm at Intel, where I work on all things performance across the SW and HW technology stack. CPU architecture, compilers, and performance analysis were always among the primary interests for me as I enjoy writing the fastest-possible code.</p>
  <p>In 2016 I started easyperf blog where I write about performance analysis and tuning, C/C++ compilers, and CPU microarchitecture. Over the course of 4 years I was able to accumulate information, which later became the basis of my book called "Performance Analysis and Tuning on Modern CPUs", which I released in 2020. After I published my book many readers suggested including more exercises in it. But I decided to go beyond that and created "Performance Ninja" online course on low-level performance tuning, which I released during summer 2021. In 2024 I published the second edition of my book. Both the book and the online course are available for FREE, enjoy!</p>
  <p>I currently live in Florida, US. I am a big proponent of an active lifestyle, which I practice in my free time. You can find me playing soccer, tennis, running, and playing chess. Besides that, I'm a husband to a beautiful wife and a father of 2 beautiful daughters.</p>
