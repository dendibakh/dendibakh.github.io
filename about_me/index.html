  <div class="about_me">
    
    <p class="lead"><b> My bio:</b></p>
    <p>I'm a senior C++ developer with more than 10 years of experience. I started my journey as a developer of desktop applications, then I developed embedded SW and now I'm at Intel, where I work on C++ compiler projects that aim at generating optimal code for a variety of different architectures. Performance engineering and compilers were always among the primary interests for me. I enjoy writing the fastest-possible code and staring at the assembly. In 2016 I started easyperf blog where I write about performance analysis and tuning, C/C++ compilers, and CPU microarchitecture.</p>
    
    <p>I live in the <span itemprop="address" itemscope > <span itemprop="locality">San Francisco Bay Area</span>, <span itemprop="region">California</span>, <span itemprop="locality">USA</span></span>. I am a big proponent of an active lifestyle, which I practice in my free time. You can find me playing soccer, tennis, running, and playing chess. Besides that, I'm a father of 2 beautiful daughters.</p>
