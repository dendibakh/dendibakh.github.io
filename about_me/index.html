  <div class="about_me">
    
    <p class="lead"><b> Hello!</b></p>
    <p>My name is Denis, I'm a SW developer with more than 13 years of experience. I started my journey as a developer of desktop applications, then I developed embedded SW and now I'm at Intel, where I work on all things performance across the SW and HW technology stack. CPU architecture, compilers, and performance analysis were always among the primary interests for me as I enjoy writing the fastest-possible code.</p>
    <p>In 2016 I started easyperf blog where I write about performance analysis and tuning, C/C++ compilers, and CPU microarchitecture. Over the course of 3-4 years I was able to accumulate information, which later became a part of my <a href="https://book.easyperf.net/perf_book">book</a> called "Performance Analysis and Tuning on Modern CPUs", which I released in 2020. After I published my book many readers suggested including more exercises in it. But I decided to go beyond that and created "Performance Ninja" <a href="https://products.easyperf.net/perf-ninja">online course</a> on low-level performance tuning. This is somewhat similar to <a href="https://easyperf.net/contest/">performance challenges</a> that we organize but with smaller and more focused lab assignments. Both the book and the online course are FREE, enjoy!</p>
    <p>You also may be interested in joining our regular bi-weekly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRWO2AL1QAV4WK6O6cxyjWVJvbUVVLrQk">TwitterSpaces</a> where we talk about SW performance (Iâ€™m the host there).</p> 
    <p>I currently live in <span itemprop="address" itemscope >Florida, US</span>. I am a big proponent of an active lifestyle, which I practice in my free time. You can find me playing soccer, tennis, running, and playing chess. Besides that, I'm a husband to a beautiful wife and a father of 2 beautiful daughters.</p>
